# Dam water flow analysis

Using Regulized linear regression and Regulized polynomial regression, the amount of water flowing out of a dam is predicted based on changes in water levels in a resservoir. The models are analyzed where the learning curves and different metrics are used, and different bias-variance settings are in action.
